									 <h1>Newsletter #4, 8 November 2025</h1>
									 <p><strong>Hello everyone, here comes newsletter number 4!</strong></p>
								</header>

								<section>
									 <p>Thanks for subscribing! Special thanks to those who signed up after my LinkedIn update this summer but haven’t received a single newsletter until now. You weren't forgotten! – This is in fact the normal frequency. :)</p>

									 <p>When I wrote the <a href="https://jansandstorm.com/22-newsletter-3.html">previous newsletter</a> I thought I was in a transition from working mostly in exercise & study mode to more original projects of my own. For example turning my <a href="https://jansandstorm.com/20-Comics_pre-production_assignment.html">comic draft</a> into a first finished comic. Somehow I guess it feels more rewarding to work on stuff that’s not tied to an assignment.</p>

									 <p>There were only a handful of pages left to add in order to make the comic complete, but when I came back after summer I just couldn’t pick it up again! Somehow I must have had enough of it, which really surprised me.</p>

									 <p>Instead of finishing the comic, I’ve been studying at university. <em>Creative writing</em> is continuing with stage II and I’m also taking a course in <em>music production</em> basics. Since I’m also continuing <em>painting</em> class, there’s limited room for projects on the side.</p>

									 <p>It's a good strategy to get something started through a course and then develop it further afterwards. But as mentioned, I’m eager to run more original projects of my own. To free up time for that, I’ve only signed up for music theory and continued painting next spring.</p>

									 <p>The goal is to reduce formal studying and dedicate more time to original projects — i.e more "learning on the job". I suspect this balance will continue to shift in the future.</p>
								</section>

								<section>
										  <p><b>This is what I'm up to right now:</b></p>

									 <h3>Comic</h3>
									 <p>I’m finding new inspiration to finish the comic. The art isn't slick at all but at least the story has a beginning, middle, and end. I'm excited to share a completed black and white version before the New Year.</p>
									 <p>Check out <a href="26-Little_Eagle_down_comic_draft_print_preview.html">this comic update </a> to see what the first pages look like in print.</p>

									 <h3>Writing</h3>
									 <p>I've written a few poems as part of the creative writing course and hope to finish a short story before the end of January. All in Swedish though, so I'm not sure they belong here.</p>

									 <h3>Music Composition</h3>
									 <p>The music production course is centered around mixing, managing, and editing audio. But I've also gone down some rabbit holes outside of the curriculum and experimented with things like software for sheet music notation and converting sheet music notation to software instruments.</p>
									 <p>The end result can of course be mixed with real analogue instruments like guitar, bass, or voice. How cool is that? Just thinking of all the possibilities gives me a headache! :)</p>

									 <h3>Art</h3>
									 <p>I’ve finished a few paintings, including <a href="https://jansandstorm.com/25-the_lemon_acrylic_painting.html">The Lemon </a> which I uploaded just now. Another one, "Woman under umbrella," is almost finished. </p>

									 <h3>Website</h3>
									 <p>The home grown web site has been updated:</p>
									 <ul>
										  <li>New navigation structure</li>
										  <li>Expandable caption text-section on each page (in case my handwriting is difficult to read)</li>
										  <li>Commenting enabled</li>
										  <li>Following via RSS enabled</li>
										  <li>JavaScript automation under the hood that can perhaps help me post more frequently (as it has been really tedious to add posts).</li>
									 </ul>
									 <p>Check out the <a href="https://jansandstorm.com/index.html">updated website here</a>.</p>
								</section>

								<footer>
									 <p>Are you working on any projects of your own? I’d love to hear how things are going! Don’t hesitate to reach out if you’re interested in collaboration or just to catch up.</p>
									 <p>Thanks for taking the time to read, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
									 <p>Best Regards,<br>Jan</p>
