		<p><b> Newsletter #1, September 12, 2024</b></p>
		<br>
 			<p>I hope you had a fantastic summer!</p>
			</p> Today it is September 12 which means it is exactly three months since I left my job and started a new life!</p> 
			<p>It's been a fun but pretty busy summer:</p>
			<p></p>

			<ul>
			<li>I started my company and had to dive into how to setup VAT reporting, small business book-keeping etc.</li>

<br>
			<li>I built a studio which has become my favourite place in the house and where I now spend my working days.</li>   
<br>
			<li>I figured out how to build a basic home page/blog that also supports handwritten content. My plan is to be able to add recordings and videos as well.</li> 
<br>
			<li>My wife K and I travelled around Sweden in our camper van for almost  two out of the three months. Mostly hiking, camping by the coast and visiting friends and family. We also spent a week in Croatia.</li>
<br>
			<li>The main reason for my life-style change was to accelerate learning. 
				<ul>	
					<li>I took two (remote) university summer courses from the camper-van. One was ”Music Harmony and arranging” at Lunds University, the other was Literature (Classic Novels) at the Mittuniversitet. </li>
					<li>Together they corresponded to full time studies which was perhaps a bit ambitious considering everything else I was up to. But it worked out well in the end and both are completed. </li>
				</ul>
<br>
			<li>Inspired by the literature course I did read more than usual this summer. The books are listed in this post (note that clicking on a book takes you to its Goodreads page, neat huh?): <a href="2-summer_books_2024.html">Summer Reading 2024</a> </li>
</ul>
<br>
		<p>Now I look forward to a productive Autumn in my studio, to testrun this home-brewed notebook/blog and start filling it with some content from the new life. </p>
		<p>Thanks for reading and let me know what you think! How was your summer by the way?</p>
		<br>
		Best Regards
		<p>/Jan</p>
