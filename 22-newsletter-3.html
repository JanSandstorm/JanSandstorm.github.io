 <h3>Newsletter #3, June 11, 2025</h3> 

	
 <p>I hope you have a great spring!</p>

    <p>In addition to helping our youngest move into his first apartment, I've mainly focused on two courses: Creative Writing (Jönköping University) and Comic Making (Uppsala University). I highly recommend both!</p>
    <p>The biggest surprise was the comic creation process. Who would have thought there’s so much work involved in making a comic?</p>
	 <p><em>Hergé</em> needed about a year to finish a typical 60-page <a href="https://tintin.fandom.com/wiki/Herg%C3%A9">Tintin album.</a></p> 
	 <p> It took <em>Glyn Dillon</em> four years(!) to complete the 200 beautiful pages in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nao-Brown-Glyn-Dillon/dp/1906838429">The Nao Of Brown.</a></p> 
	 <p>That’s almost a week per page for both authors. —I'm not sure I have that kind of patience!</p>

    <p>Anyway, the comic course includes making a comic loosely based on a personal experience. I chose the time our mobile home broke down a couple of years ago —and added quite a bit of drama and horror, here's a panel example:  <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fsn10fbnas3r5jk3jurto/Little_Eagle_Down-Checking_the_engine.JPG?rlkey=1nopjh5cz7venmf65gc5npdru&raw=1" alt="Panel from Little Eagle Down comic"> 
 I’m still finishing the last pages, but you can check out an early stage part of the pre-production pitch <a href="20-Comics_pre-production_assignment.html">here.</a></p>
	 <br>	
	 <p>Painting class continued this spring and I shared some outcomes here: <a href="19-painting_class_woman_in_bar.html">Woman in Reykjavik Bar</a></p> 
	 <p><a href="21-Acrylic_painting_woman_in_hat.html">My version of Matisse's Woman with a Hat</a> </p>
	 <br>
    <p>I’m continuing university this autumn but only at 75%. The remaining 25% will be used for a creative project of some kind.

    So far I’ve only scratched the surface when it comes to creative skill-building, but, I’m too old to drag my feet: It’s time to take on a project to test what I’ve learned! Perhaps a comic or short story collection? More on that in the next newsletter, stay tuned!</p>

	 <p>I would love to hear what <em>you're </em> up to, and I wish you a wonderful summer!</p>

    <p>Best regards,<br>Jan</p>
