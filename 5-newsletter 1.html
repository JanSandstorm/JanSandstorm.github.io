		<p><b> Newsletter #1, January 24, 2024</b></p>
		<br>
		<p>Time for the first newsletter as promised!</p>
		<p>The blog is now up and running but I have not added as many posts as I thought I would have. Especially less added music and text than expected, - blogging apparently takes much more time than I thought ;)</p>
		<p>At least I created an <a href="https://jansandstorm.com/1-about.html">About me</a> page that hopefully gives a bit of context.</p>
		<p>After that came the first "real" post: a test-run combining writing, music and picture pretty much the way I intended for this blog to work. It contains a photo of my wife taking a photo of the horizon at a place close to where she grew up in Sweden called Flatruet. The picture is combined with a short guitar improvisation and a little poem. For some reason the poem ended up in Swedish which is probably not great for an blog otherwise written in English. I tried to translate but it just fell flat so I left it for now. So just disregard the poem and check out the rest here: <a href="https://jansandstorm.com/2-mountain_path_photo.html">Path fading away</a>.</p>
		<p>The page following that is just two comic-like doodled characters taken from my note-book. They are discussing what's coming up on the next page: <a href="https://jansandstorm.com/3-whats%20on%20the%20next%20page.html">So what's on the next page</a>.</p>
		<p>The last page added before this newsletter contains a photo from a forest walk this week-end. The trees are naked with twisting branches covered in snow. It looked like a black and white photo even in reality! <a href="https://jansandstorm.com/4-snowy%20tangled%20forest.html">Snowy, tangled forest</a>.</p>
		<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
		<br>
		<p>/Jan</p>
